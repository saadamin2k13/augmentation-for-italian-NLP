## Augmentation-for-DRS-to-text-generation

In this repo, we include the code for our CLiC-it-2024 paper entitled:

### "Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Italian NLP:Enhancing Semantic Processing with DRS"

Here, we include:

1. **dataset:** this folder includes all flavors of augmented datasets and also the dataset without augmentation. 
2. **evaluation_scripts:** this folder contains scripts to evaluate model performance through automatic and pre-trained model-based evaluation metrics for both parsing and generation. 
3. **model_generated_outputs:** this folder contains the model-generated outputs for all the experiments reported in the paper.
4. **scripts:** all dataset processing scripts for dataset processing and augmentation are present in the folder.




**1. Figure below represents the DRS/SBN transformations.**
